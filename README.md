# Website

**long overdue** personal website.

## Tasks

some things to put this together:

1. A list of work to upload to the website, alongside accompanying text, images etc.
2. A rough idea of how I want the site to look (*I'm keeping things simple, but an existing website I can refer to would be helpful*)
3. Get to better grips with HTML and CSS (*see above digression in italics*)
